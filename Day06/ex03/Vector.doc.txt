Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class allows to place points in space and even give
them a simple color. 

Used with Color.class.php and Vertex.class.php.

Vector is represented according to five characteristics:
• Its x axis coordinate
• Its y axis coordinate
• Its z depth coordinate

An instance can be contructed from distinct x, y, z and w constitutives:
Example:
	new Vertex( array( 'x' => -12.34, 'y' => 23.45, 'z' => -34.56 ) );

The class provides the following methods :

Vector magnitude();
Returns the vector’s length.

Vector normalize();
returns a normalized version of the vector. 
If the vector is already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Vector add(Vector $rhs);
Returns the sum vector of both vectors.

Vector sub(Vector $rhs);
Returns the difference vector of both vectors.

Vector opposite();
Returns the opposite vector.

Vector  scalarProduct($k);
Returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.

Vector dotProduct(Vector $rhs);
Returns the scalar multiplication of both vectors.

Vector cos(Vector $rhs);
Returns the angle’s cosinus between both vectors.

Vector crossProduct(Vector $rhs);
Returns the cross multiplication of both vectors (right-hand mark!)
